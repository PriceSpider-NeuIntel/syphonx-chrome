P1:
a directory that only contains sub-directories (i.e. no files) is not visible in the file open/save dialogs



P2:
Add button should not scroll within the tree view
regex's display with single back slashes in query editor but with double back slashes in property sheet
File chip doesn't change when saving to a different file name
Save template dialog path should change in edit box as different folders are clicked
Prompt for unsaved changes
Toolbar should not scroll out of view in data view
Add button blocks menu on selected item
selector hilighting not working on coned
selector gadget crashes on coned
selector gadget not picking up semantic names on cwlaw
can't create a union unless type=object, union should be supported for any type
duplicating a property doesn't change the name and screws up selection

FIXED:
entering values for snooze don't persist
File open doesn't display busy status when opening template
when filename is too long it pushes the right aligned controls out of the viewport in the appbar
add selector dialog should reset type and repeated settings every timestamp
choosing subselect with type=object and name=(none) causes rendering error... Cannot read properties of null (reading 'key')
clearing selector in query builder should delete the query
number the union cases
add button when union is selected doesn't add another union case
query shouldn't be required if union is defined
query shouldn't be required if type=object
warnings on union don't bubble up to the property
