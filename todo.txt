BUGS
Crash opening schwabe/person.json, error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {name}). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.
CSS Selector not highlighting in DOM on change
output is only updating the first time
wait to dismiss file dialog until after file operation is complete, on error set ribbon and don't close the dialog
file save doesn't work
prompt for unsaved changes
selector highlighting doesn't work on property page
Disable autorun for non-select-only templates
Fix position of add button so it doesn't scroll within the tree
Add button blocks menu on selected item
Change key for undefined name to ? (so it doesn't collide with a name of "undefined")

CONSIDER
Consider renaming SelectorField to QueryField, and how to pass other properites to it
Consider refactoring to useQueryBuilder pattern
Consider moving SnoozeMode out of SnoozeInterval in core
Consider adding a context field to Yield in core
