# SyphonX Chrome Extension

This is the Chrome Extension editor/runner for SyphonXâ€”a light weight, no-code web-scraper that runs in any browser.

## New user install
1. Download the latest version from https://github.com/dtempx/syphonx-chrome/releases/
2. Extract the zip file
3. Open Chrome Extensions by clicking on **Settings > Extensions** or navigate to `chrome://extensions`
4. Enable **Developer mode** in the upper right corner *(only have to do this once per system)*
5. Click on **Load unpacked**
6. Navigate to the folder that contains the file extracted from step 2 and click **Open**

To use the extension, hit F12 from any tab to open devtools and select the SyphonX panel.

> The extension must be re-installed after every system restart as manually loaded Chrome extensions do not persist across shutdowns.
